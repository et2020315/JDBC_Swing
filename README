README for Phase 3 Project

The line for "Enter query" will allow users to enter a raw SQL query.

The following will explain the input parameters of each button and dropdown.
Only commands with confusing input parameters will be included.



Buttons: Basic functions

Show Columns of Table: First argument is a table name, second argument is the
columns you wish to see separated by space. Case-sensitive.

Join Tables: The join conditions between table entries are raw SQL conditional
syntax, e.g. table1.col = table2.col



Dropdown: Required commands and custom commands

Get stats: if you scroll to the right, there is a line explaining how many counts each star represents.

Get customer info: first parameter is sql conditional syntax (e.g. table1.col < 100), second parameter is column name if you wish to group by that column name. Columns can be chosen from customer, address, stateprovince, and countryregion.
This will return all the locational information of all customers.

Get customer orders: first parameter is same as above (acceptable tables are customer, salesorderheader, salesorderdetail), second is either blank, aggregate, or aggregate-by-sales. 
This will return all the purchase information of customers, including all products they purchased.
If aggregate is the second parameter, it will return the aggregate info for each customer.
If aggregate-by-sales is the second parameter, it will return the aggregate info for each unique sale.

Both of the above may take a while to display since they deal with huge amounts of data if there is no conditional syntax.
Please give them time.
