I added the jdb-customer-info command. It lets user get customer info including address and ID, and lets them input a choosing criteria with SQL. They also have the option to group by some parameter.

I finished another custom command which is jdb-customer-orders that gets each customer's orders. You can view all orders, you can view them aggregated by sale, or view them aggregated by customer. I also modified the first custom command so for each customer it will also show aggregated sales info. Needless to say, this took way too long and kept me up until 4:30 am.

I finished the jdb-stat command.

Added basic command buttons and dropdown to mainframe, connected them to command listener

Modified the code structure of mainframe so it's more understandable, modified GUI display

Modified prompt input so that it conditionally validates arguments before sending the command to be processed
